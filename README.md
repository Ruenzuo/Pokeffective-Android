Pokeffective-Android
====================

__Description:__

PokéApp (formerly Pokeffective) is a party balance calculator, what is that? First, you add pokémon to your box and fill their movesets with the current generation information, I can understand that this might be a problem that's why I'll be adding previous generations information soon. Then, you can select up to three pokémon to analize their effectiveness against the 18 type of pokémon in two modes: attacking and defending.

__Please, read:__

Google rejected my app without giving me any reasons, but that's OK, it was a risky project anyway. I'm releasing the source code so anyone interested in check how this app words hopefuly can learn something. Beware, I never intented to do this when I first make the app, so the code it's a little messy. Would appreciate feedback. Also, please read the [license](https://github.com/Ruenzuo/Pokeffective-Android/blob/master/License) and don't be a jackass.
